I was recently working on a rust crate (read library) for parsing input files for Conway's game of life. The idea was to have a `Parser` trait like this:
```rust
use std::io::Read;

pub trait Parser {
	fn parse<T: Read>(&mut self, input: T) -> Result<GameDescriptor>;
}
```

The idea was to be as rustacenous (code like a rustacean?) as possible and use the standard traits where applicable. In this case this means accepting a `Read` as input, similarly to accepting an `InputStream` in a Java class.

I was writing unit tests when I came upon a slight problem: I didn't want to create test data files for simple tests, so ideally in my test I would just pass a string to the `parse` method. But Rust's `String` doesn't implement `Read` (why not??). Recalling the rules around trait implementations, I knew I couldn't implement `Read` for `String` myself.

The Rust [book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/first-edition/traits.html#rules-for-implementing-traits):
> either the trait or the type youâ€™re implementing it for must be defined by you. Or more precisely, one of them must be defined in the same crate as the impl you're writing.

I didn't find any solution for this on the web, and no crates that help with this issue either. So I decided to publish one myself: [stringreader](https://crates.io/crates/stringreader).

## StringReader

Here's the basic code:
```rust
pub struct StringReader<'a> {
    iter: Iter<'a, u8>,
}

impl<'a> StringReader<'a> {
    pub fn new(data: &'a str) -> Self {
        Self {
            iter: data.as_bytes().iter(),
        }
    }
}
```
Simple enough, the struct contains an `Iter<'a, u8>` (more on that later), and there's a constructor that accepts a `&'a str`, so the lifetime of the `StringReader` must not exceed that of the input. The iterator inside `StringReader` is initialized by converting the input to a slice of bytes (`&[u8]`) and then getting an iterator for that slice.

## Implementing the Read trait
The `std::io::Read` trait requires only a single method to be implemented, but it provides some additional helpers via default implementations. In order to make `StringReader` implement `Read` one needs to provide an implementation for `read`:
```rust
fn read(&mut self, buf: &mut [u8]) -> Result<usize>;
```

The read method accepts a mutable slice of `u8` (read unsigned byte) and returns a `std::io::Result<usize>`, where the positive result should contain the number of bytes read. At first I thought "why isn't there a parameter telling me how many bytes to read?", but then I remembered that slices in Rust know their length, so there can't be a buffer overflow.

My implementation for the trait looks like this:
```rust
impl<'a> Read for StringReader<'a> {
    fn read(&mut self, buf: &mut [u8]) -> Result<usize> {
        for i in 0..buf.len() {
            if let Some(x) = self.iter.next() {
                buf[i] = *x;
            } else {
                return Ok(i);
            }
        }
        Ok(buf.len())
    }
}
```

I iterate over a range from 0 to the length (exclusive) of the passed-in byte slice. Then, for each index, I try to get the next byte from the iterator and, if it's a `Some`, write it to the slice. Otherwise, if the iterator returns a `None`, we know we've reached the end of the string, so we return a positive result with the number of bytes read. If the end of the for loop is reached we just return the length of the slice.

## Using StringReader in practice
Using the newly created crate, i could write relatively simple tests like this one:
```rust
use stringreader::StringReader;
// init parser
let input = StringReader::new("#N");
parser.parse(input);
// assertions
```

## Conclusions
I was really surprised that `std::io::Read` isn't implemented for Rust's string type(s), but in the end this allowed me to contribute a (imho) useful crate to the community. That Rust's slices provide an iterator was very helpful in accomplishing the task. All in all I'm satisfied with the crate and I hope it'll help others as well.

Thanks for reading!
